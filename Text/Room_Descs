A winding hallway leads you to a drafty octogonal room with pristine wooden walls. Vines and plants grow from the cracks in the wood floor. Moss that lines the wall seems to be glowing, giving off a mysterious light. Items scattered throughout the room indicate that it may have been a bathroom.
All you can hear is cackling as you enter a hidden room with polished wooden walls. An inch of water covers the clay floor. The room is absent of light, but candles line the wall.
Quiet whispers are barely audible as you enter a dreadful room, where the crumbling metallic walls have missing portions that show through to the earth. Snakes slither from your sight across the battered floor. A faint light fills the room, from an unknown source
The shrieks of a wounded animal pierce the silence as you enter a chilly pentagonal room; the fortified walls covered in dust. An elegant seal is inlayed in the old floor. Sunlight trickles into the room. Hanging from a chain in the ceiling is a jar with an eye floating in it.
